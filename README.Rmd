> _Extensible_ TMLE framework

__Author:__ [Jeremy Coyle](https://github.com/jeremyrcoyle)

---

## What's `tmle3`?

`tmle3` is a general framework that supports the implementation of a range of
TMLE parameters with a unified interface. The goal is for the `tmle3` software
framework to be as general as the mathematical framework upon which it's based.

---

## Installation

You can install the development version of `tmle3` from GitHub via
[`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/) with

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("tlverse/tmle3")
```

---

## Getting Started

The best place to get started is the _Framework Overview_, which describes the
individual components of the `tmle3` framework. You can find it here:
https://tmle3.tlverse.org/articles/framework.html.
